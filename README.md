## Introduction
You operate a supermarket mall and collect basic customer data via membership cards. This data comprises Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score, which is derived from customer behavior and purchase patterns.

## Problem Statement
As the owner of the mall, you aim to understand the customers, particularly those who can be easily converged (Target Customers). This understanding is crucial for providing insights to the marketing team and planning strategies accordingly.

## Comparative Analysis
An analysis was conducted using clustering algorithms including DBSCAN, K-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering. The comparative analysis revealed the inadequacy of DBSCAN in forming meaningful clusters due to its reliance on the density of points. K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, on the other hand, successfully formed meaningful clusters, facilitating insightful customer segmentation analysis.

## Summary and Recommendations
After employing the clustering algorithms to analyze customer data, distinct segments with unique characteristics were identified, leading to tailored strategies:

### Approachable Customers:
- Characteristics: Substantial income but low spending.
- Strategy: Implementing a membership program could effectively stimulate spending behavior within this segment.

### Spender Customers:
- Characteristics: High spending behavior.
- Strategy: Targeted discount promotions on products aligned with their preferences could be impactful. Further analysis with additional purchasing data is required to personalize the approach for this segment.

### High Target & Neutral Customers:
- Strategy: Focus on fostering loyalty and encouraging consistent visits to the mall within these segments.

### Low Target Customers (Low Priority):
- Characteristics: Limited income and spending scores.
- Recommendation: Allocate fewer resources towards engaging these customers due to their low potential for significant spending.
